# 🩺 **Diabetes Prediction App** 📊

Welcome to the **Diabetes Prediction App**! This application is designed to visualize and predict whether a person has diabetes based on the **PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset**. The app uses the **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** algorithm to make predictions and provides various visualizations to help you understand the data better.

## 🌱 **Features**:
- **Data Overview**: View key statistics and check for missing values in the dataset.
- **Visualization Tools**:
  - 📊 **Countplot**: Shows the distribution of diabetes outcomes (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
  - 📦 **Boxplots**: Detect outliers and visualize the spread of each feature.
  - 👯‍♂️ **Pairplot**: Understand relationships between different features.
  - 📈 **Histograms with KDE**: See the distribution of each feature.
  - 🧠 **Correlation Heatmap**: Visualize correlations between features.
- **Model Training**:
  - ⚙️ **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**: Train the model and predict diabetes based on selected features.
  - 🎛 **Adjustable k-value**: Experiment with different values of k to see how accuracy changes.

## 🔍 **How It Works**:
The app leverages machine learning to predict whether a person has diabetes. It uses the **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** algorithm and allows users to adjust the value of **k** (number of nearest neighbors) to optimize prediction accuracy.

### 🚀 **Steps**:
1. **Load Data**: The app loads the **PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset** and displays a preview of the data.
2. **Visualize Data**: It provides several visualizations to explore the dataset:
   - Countplot of diabetes outcomes
   - Boxplots for each feature to check for outliers
   - Pairplot to show relationships between features
   - Histograms to display the distribution of each feature
   - Correlation heatmap to understand feature correlations
3. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is standardized using **StandardScaler** to ensure fair model training.
4. **Model Training**: The app uses **kNN** to classify diabetes based on the features. You can adjust the **k-value** to observe the impact on accuracy.
5. **Evaluate the Model**: After training, the app displays the **Confusion Matrix** and **Classification Report** to show model performance.
