🩺 **Diabetes Prediction App** 📊

This app helps visualize and predict **diabetes** using the **PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset**. 🌱

🔍 **Dataset Overview**:
The dataset contains information like:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times the patient has been pregnant.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg / height in m^2).
- **Age**: Age of the patient.
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: A function which scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.

🧠 **How It Works**:
The app uses a **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** model to classify whether a person has diabetes or not based on these features.

**Visualizations**:
1. 📊 **Countplot** of the diabetes outcomes (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
2. 📦 **Boxplots** to show the spread of data and detect outliers.
3. 👯‍♂️ **Pairplot** to show relationships between different features.
4. 📈 **Histograms** with KDE to show the distribution of each feature.
5. 🧠 **Correlation Heatmap** to understand the correlation between features.

⚙️ **Model**:
- **kNN** algorithm is used to classify data based on the distance between feature points.
- You can select the **value of k** (1 to 15) to see how the model's accuracy changes.

📉 **Performance**:
- **Confusion Matrix** and **Classification Report** show detailed insights into the model's performance.

🎯 **Conclusion**:
- Use this app to visualize data, experiment with the model's k-value, and get an understanding of how well the kNN algorithm predicts diabetes.
